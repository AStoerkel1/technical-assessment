Today I got familiar with the codebase and got both servers running locally.
I also decided to get some boiler plate out of the way, makeing a Quest.js in types
modeled after the Hero class. I also wrote out the QuestsDB.js modeled after HeroesDB.js
This is all just needed to get started working on the routes and make sure that I'll be
able to test them.
